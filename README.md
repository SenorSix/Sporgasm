Sporgasm started as a need to practice web development. I had microscopy photos and videos I made sitting on my hard drive and a domain, www.sporgasm.org, that had been sitting dormant for over a year.

This is where I built my foundation in Python, Flask, and server management.

What began as a way to teach myself backend development evolved into a full-stack project served from a self-managed Linux server. Sporgasm now showcases microscopy content, embedded tools, and exploratory project branches — all with a deployment pipeline I built from scratch.

It is not a finished project and there's plenty more I intend to do with it
